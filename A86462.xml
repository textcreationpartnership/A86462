            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HOLLANDERS <hi>Emba≈ø≈øage to</hi> ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET no Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like look or ca≈øt a view upon the≈øe lines, le≈øt he find him≈øelf more ≈øhook, than one trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Tertian Ague: for he ≈øhall find here no comfort, but many cro≈ø≈øes, no Pope wor≈øhipped, but in the Highway to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. No trea≈øon broaching, but traytors ≈øet on tilt, all Popi≈øh dregs being ca≈øt forth for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell to feed upon. No Peace proclaimed to the Babyloni≈øh Whore, but a bloody warre; no Comedie but a Tragedie. Performed not alone by the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but al≈øo by true and noble ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who≈øe love to <hi>England</hi> hath, and is daily expre≈ø≈øed, which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is able
<pb facs="tcp:156346:3"/>to witne≈ø≈øe; but not delight to heare of, in regard that their plate hath ≈øo often ≈øupplyed the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers coffers, in ≈øpite of Spains proude≈øt Dons or Romes malicious cur≈øes, who are able to do as much harme as their ble≈øsings good.</p>
            <p>O what a heart-aching to them was that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Marriage; of our High-born Prince≈ø≈øe the Lady <hi>Marie</hi> to that worthy Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Na≈ø≈øau</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ≈øure it was as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall unto them, as their overthrow in eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, eight: but it is ours and <hi>Hollands</hi> joy, who≈øe loyaltie late proffered for the good both of our King and Country, I thus relate.</p>
            <p>The newes being arrived in <hi>Holland,</hi> of the Prote≈øtants in <hi>Irelands</hi> calamity, they, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> were very much grieved, as if that they had been partakers of the others mi≈øerie.</p>
            <p>And truly, ≈øo it doth behove each well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Chri≈øtian, who is ambitious of nothing, but to embrace true Pietie, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt and ayd his friend being in adver≈øitie.</p>
            <p>The heathen Queen <hi>Dido</hi> having been once in trouble her ≈øelf, did the rather give ear to the Trojan Prince <hi>Aeneas</hi> his misfortunes, ≈øaying thus;
<q>‚Äî <hi>Mi≈øeris ≈øuccurrere di≈øco.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Having been in trouble my ≈øelf, I learn now to ≈øuccour tho≈øe which are troubled.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156346:3"/>
            <p> And yet there are a ≈øort of people in the world, which are friends to none but tho≈øe which are in pro≈øperitie, which <hi>Ovid</hi> having had experience of, writ thus;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Donec ≈øaelix multos numerabis amicos,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Tempora ≈øi fuerint nubila, ≈øolus eris.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As long as a man is happie, that is, worldly rich, he ≈øhall be ≈øure to want no friends: but his pro≈øperitie being eclip≈øed with clouds of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øitie, then his former ≈øycophanrs will an≈øwer him, with a truely I have forgot you.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> prove them≈øelves to be of another Nature, making this loving proffer.</p>
            <p>That if they might have priviledge to fight upon his Maje≈øties Seas, there ≈øhould neither pa≈ø≈øe by them, <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> fleet, to do either the Prote≈øtants of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> any harm.</p>
            <p>Thus they proffered not when the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> were in pro≈øperitie, but now being in adver≈øitie, which is true friend≈øhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and now to make their proffer good, they have proceeded to action.</p>
            <p>Thirtie of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> men of warre ≈øcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up and down the Seas toward <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:156346:4"/>becau≈øe it was reported in <hi>Holland,</hi> that a Navie was di≈øpatching from <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to aid the Rebels in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who≈øe Navie the≈øe Hollanders with their pro≈øpective gla≈ø≈øes di≈øcovered, and pre≈øently di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched their packet-boat unto Sir <hi>Iohn Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington,</hi> Vice-Admirall of his Maje≈øties Seas, to know whether they ≈øhould ≈øet vpon them or not, who having no Commi≈øsion from the King or Parliament, gave them no An≈øwer pre≈øently, but fir≈øt ≈øent Letters to know whether their pa≈ø≈øage ≈øhould be ≈øtopt or no, who≈øe An≈øwer was, that it ≈øhould.</p>
            <p>Then to the ≈øame effect did Sir <hi>Iohn Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> an≈øwer the Hollanders Me≈ø≈øenger, of which they were as joyfull as the birds of the Spring, ≈øayling bravely towards them, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of the Dunkirk Navie.</p>
            <p>Who ≈øtood upon their guard as well as they could, but the Hollanders made ≈øuch havocke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them, at length they had little courage to go to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Rebels in Ireland, having ≈øo much to do at home, the fight la≈øted above forty eight houres, many of the ≈øhips which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Dunkirk were taken, and many ≈øunk, to the eternall honour of the Hollanders, but di≈øgrace of them≈øelves: thus doth God revenge their cau≈øe which put their tru≈øt in him.</p>
